## Individual Project (BMED365): Digital Poster and Speed Presentation

_**Individual Project - Weeks 6-7 2025**:  You will work independently on your individual (**topic selected by you according to guidelines***) project during Weeks 6 and 7. 
You have the flexibility to complete this work at your preferred time and location. The projects will culminate in a "speed-poster" presentation session on Wednesday, **February 19th from 8:15 AM to 12:00 PM**._

## Overview
This individual project takes place between the first and second blocks of BMED365. While the second block focuses on computational biomedical imaging (MRI, IMC, etc.) and modeling, students will work independently on a project of their choice within the course scope. This project consists of two main deliverables:
1. A digital poster submitted through Mitt UiB
2. A "speed-poster" presentation to fellow students

## *Project Guidelines

### Topic Selection
* Choose a topic from the BMED365 curriculum that includes one or more of:
  * Computational imaging
  * Computational modeling
  * Artificial intelligence
* The topic can be based on:
  * Your own research
  * A scientific article
  * A methods review with pros/cons analysis
* Faculty guidance is available for topic selection during early preparation

### Digital Poster
* Create your poster using the [suggested template](./assets/BMED365_poster_70x120_template.pptx)
