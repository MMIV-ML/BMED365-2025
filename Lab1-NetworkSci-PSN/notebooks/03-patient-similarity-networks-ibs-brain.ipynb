    "   - Node size indicates degree (number of connections)\n",
    "   - Colors represent centrality (from purple=low to yellow=high)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Network Structure:**\n",
    "   - There are several hub patients (larger nodes) that are well-connected\n",
    "   - A few nodes show high centrality (green/yellow) indicating they are important bridge points\n",
    "   - The network shows clear clustering, suggesting subgroups of similar patients\n",

    "   - The clusters might represent distinct patient subgroups with similar characteristics\n",
    "   - The bridge nodes (high centrality) could represent patients with characteristics that span multiple groups\n",
    "   - The network is well-connected overall, suggesting gradual transitions between patient types\n",
    "   - Peripheral nodes might represent patients with unique or unusual combinations of characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Network Properties:**\n",
    "   - The network appears to have good balance between connectivity and structure\n",
    "   - The chosen threshold and k-nearest neighbor parameters have created meaningful groupings\n",
    "   - The visualization effectively shows both local connections and global structure\n",

    "   - The distribution shows a primary peak around 250-275 on the IBS Severity Score scale\n",
    "   - There appears to be a bimodal distribution with a smaller secondary peak around 400\n",
    "   - The distribution is slightly right-skewed\n",

    "2. **From Figure 2 (Severity by Community):**\n",
    "   - Four distinct communities were identified\n",
    "   - Community 2 shows the highest median severity and largest variability\n",
    "   - Community 4 has the lowest median severity and most compact distribution\n",
    "   - Communities 1 and 3 show intermediate severity levels\n",
    "   - Several outliers are present, particularly in Communities 1 and 2 (dots above boxes)\n",
    "   - The interquartile ranges (box sizes) vary considerably between communities, suggesting different levels of homogeneity\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **From Figure 3 (Correlation Matrix):**\n",
    "   - There is a moderate negative correlation (-0.18) between Age and IBS_SSS, suggesting slightly lower severity in older patients\n",
    "   - Education shows very weak correlations with both IBS_SSS (-0.02) and Age (-0.0043), indicating minimal relationship\n",
    "   - The correlations are generally weak, suggesting that demographic factors alone don't strongly predict IBS severity\n",
    "   - The strongest relationship observed is the negative Age-IBS_SSS correlation, though still relatively weak\n",
    "\n",
