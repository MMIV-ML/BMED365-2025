    "### Simon Willison's LLM tool\n",
    "Simon Willison's LLM tool (https://github.com/simonw/llm) can be installed using several methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using pip\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to install LLM is using pip (in the bmed365-cuda environment):\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install llm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using pipx (recommended)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more isolated installation, you can use pipx:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pipx install llm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Homebrew\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're on macOS or Linux and have Homebrew installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install llm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "After installation, you can verify that LLM is working by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "llm -v\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting up OpenAI API (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use OpenAI's models, you'll need to set up your API key:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "llm keys set openai\n",
    "# Paste your OpenAI API key when prompted\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM supports various plugins for additional functionality. For example, to install Ollama plugin for local models:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "llm install llm-ollama\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to keep LLM updated. You can upgrade it using the same method you used to install it, such as `pip install -U llm` or `brew upgrade llm`[1][2][4].\n",

    "## DeepSeek-R1\n",
    "\n",
    "To install DeepSeek-R1 in Simon Willison's LLM tool, you can follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, ensure you have LLM installed (if not, install it using pip)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "llm --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Install the llm-ollama plugin:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "llm install llm-ollama\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. See **Ollama** below for how to install Ollama. <br>Use **Ollama to download and run the DeepSeek-R1 model**. We will need to install a **Destilled Model**, as the full model is too large to run locally. <br> Check out https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1 and the [DeepSeek-R1](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/20/deepseek-r1/) page for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open your terminal and execute:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ollama run deepseek-r1:70b   OR (https://ollama.com/library/deepseek-r1)\n",
    "ollama run deepseek-r1:8b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will download the model, which may take some time depending on your internet speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Once the model is downloaded, you can use it with LLM. Set up an alias for easier access:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "llm aliases set r1 deepseek-r1:70b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Now you can use DeepSeek-R1 in LLM with the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "llm -m r1 \"Your prompt here\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For a specific example using a distilled version of DeepSeek-R1, you can use:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "llm -m 'hf.co/unsloth/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B-GGUF:Q8_0' 'Your prompt here'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows you to use DeepSeek-R1 locally through LLM, leveraging Ollama for model management[1][4][7].\n",

      "Okay, so I need to create a Python function called lcm that calculates the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers. Then, I have to write another function called run_tests which will run five test cases for this LCM function. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I remember that the LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that both can divide into without leaving a remainder. But wait, isn't there a formula involving the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)? Yeah, right! The formula is LCM(a, b) = |a * b| / GCD(a, b). So, I need to find the GCD first.\n",
      "\n",
      "How do I compute the GCD? Oh, Euclidean algorithm is the way to go. Let me recall: you divide the larger number by the smaller one, then replace the larger number with the smaller and the smaller with the remainder from the division. Repeat until the remainder is zero, and the non-zero remainder just before that is the GCD.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I should write a helper function inside the lcm function to compute the GCD. Alternatively, I can use Python's built-in math.gcd function, but wait—it returns the positive GCD, right? Also, if either number is zero, the LCM would be undefined because division by zero isn't possible. So I need to handle cases where a or b is zero.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, in mathematics, the LCM of 0 and another number is technically not defined since any multiple of 0 is 0, but in programming contexts, it's often considered as 0 if both are zero? Or maybe return None? Hmm, perhaps I should check that neither a nor b is zero before proceeding. If either is zero, raise an error or handle it somehow.\n",
      "\n",
      "But for now, let me think about the normal cases where both numbers are non-zero. So using math.gcd might be easier than implementing Euclidean myself unless I'm required to do so. Let me assume that importing math is acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but what if a and b are negative? Since LCM is always positive, right? Because it's about multiples, which are positive by definition. So maybe the function should take absolute values of a and b first.\n",
      "\n",
      "So here's the plan for lcm(a, b):\n",
      "1. If either a or b is zero, return 0 (as per some definitions) or perhaps raise an error. Let me think—mathematically, LCM(0, x) is undefined because every number divides 0, but in programming contexts, sometimes it's considered as 0 for both zeros? Hmm, not sure. Maybe to handle edge cases, if a or b is zero, return 0.\n",
      "2. Otherwise, compute the absolute values of a and b since LCM is positive.\n",
      "3. Compute GCD using math.gcd, but note that math.gcd in Python returns 0 if both a and b are zero, which might cause division by zero error.\n",
      "4. So first check if either a or b is zero. If yes, return 0. Else, compute LCM as (abs(a) * abs(b)) // gcd.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but what about when both a and b are negative? Since their product will be positive, so the absolute value isn't necessary for the multiplication part. But math.gcd returns the same regardless of sign because it's based on absolute values. So no problem there.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let me outline steps in code:\n",
      "\n",
      "Import math\n",
      "\n",
      "def lcm(a, b):\n",
      "    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n",
      "        return 0\n",
      "    gcd = math.gcd(abs(a), abs(b))\n",
      "    return abs(a * b) // gcd\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but what about when one of them is zero? Like LCM(5, 0). Is that defined? According to some sources, yes, it's considered as 0. So returning 0 in such cases is acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if both are zero, math.gcd would return 0, and then division by zero occurs. But since we already check for a or b being zero at the start, we return 0, so that part is safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, moving on to writing the run_tests function. This should test five different cases, maybe including some edge cases like zeros, negative numbers, large numbers, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let me think of five test cases:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Test case 1: LCM(4, 6). Expected result is 12.\n",
      "2. Test case 2: LCM(0, 5). Expected result is 0.\n",
      "3. Test case 3: LCM(-3, 9). Since LCM is always positive, expected 9.\n",
      "4. Test case 4: LCM(8, 12). Expected 24.\n",
      "5. Test case 5: LCM(17, 19). They are primes, so LCM should be 17*19=323.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but for test case 2, if a is zero and b is non-zero, the function returns 0, which seems correct. But what about when both are zero? Maybe add another test case, but since we have only five, perhaps that's acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, maybe test case with larger numbers to check performance or correctness: LCM(123456789, 987654321). Let me compute it using the formula: their product divided by GCD. The GCD of those two might be something, but perhaps not necessary for testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe test case with co-prime numbers: like LCM(8, 15)=120.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's stick to five test cases as per instructions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, how to structure the run_tests function? I can have a list of tuples where each tuple has two integers and the expected result. Then loop through each tuple, compute lcm(a, b), compare with expected, print pass or fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "def run_tests():\n",
      "    test_cases = [\n",
      "        (4, 6, 12),\n",
      "        (0, 5, 0),\n",
      "        (-3, 9, 9),\n",
      "        (8, 12, 24),\n",
      "        (17, 19, 323)\n",
      "    ]\n",
      "    for a, b, expected in test_cases:\n",
      "        result = lcm(a, b)\n",
      "        if result == expected:\n",
      "            print(f\"Test passed: LCM({a}, {b}) = {expected}\")\n",
      "        else:\n",
      "            print(f\"Test failed: Expected {expected}, got {result}\")\n",
      "\n",
      "That should work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but what about the case where both a and b are zero? Since in our function, if either is zero, it returns 0. So for test case (0, 0), would expect perhaps 0 or an error. But since our test_cases don't include this, maybe it's okay. Alternatively, we can add another test case.\n",
      "\n",
      "But given the requirement is five tests, let me proceed with those above.\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together: import math at the top, define lcm function, then run_tests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should also think about importing math within the lcm function or globally. Since Python requires imports to be at the top of the file, but since we are writing a script, maybe import math before defining functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, in some contexts, it's possible to import inside the function, but that's not efficient if the function is called multiple times. But for this case, perhaps just include import math at the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, actually, no—the import statement needs to be outside of the function definitions because otherwise, every time lcm is called, it tries to import math again, which is unnecessary and could cause issues in some cases, though Python handles that by not re-importing modules multiple times. But conventionally, imports are placed at the top.\n",
      "\n",
      "So code structure:\n",
      "\n",
      "import math\n",
      "\n",
      "def lcm(a, b):\n",
      "    if a == 0 or b == 0:\n",
      "        return 0\n",
      "    gcd = math.gcd(abs(a), abs(b))\n",
      "    return abs(a * b) // gcd\n",
      "\n",
      "def run_tests():\n",
      "    test_cases = [\n",

      "Alright, so I need to figure out how to write a Python function that calculates the lowest common multiple (LCM) of two integers. Hmm, okay. I remember that LCM is related to the greatest common divisor (GCD). Let me recall: there's a formula that connects LCM and GCD, right? It goes something like LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b). Yeah, that seems familiar.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, first things first, I need a way to compute the GCD of two numbers. Python has a built-in function for this called math.gcd(), but wait, isn't that only available in Python 3.5 and above? Let me check—yes, it is. So, I can use that. But hold on, what if the numbers are zero? Because GCD(0, b) is b, right? So I need to handle cases where either a or b is zero.\n",

      "Alright, so putting this together. My LCM function will take two integers as input. Let's name them a and b. First, I'll compute their product: a * b. But wait, if either a or b is zero, the LCM would be zero as well because anything multiplied by zero is zero. So I should check for that first.\n",

      "\n",
      "So, putting it all together, the LCM function can be written as:\n",

      "\n",
      "Example 1: a = 4, b = 6\n",
      "GCD(4, 6) is 2. So LCM should be (4*6)/2 = 24/2 = 12. Let's see if the function returns that. Yes, it does.\n",

      "Example 3: a = -8, b = 12\n",
      "LCM should be (8*12)/4 = 96/4 =24. Let's see, the function returns 24 because it takes absolute values first. Yep, that works.\n",

    "introspective, sometimes melancholic but also hopeful.\n",

    "I need to write this in Norwegian, which is a bit tricky since I'm more \n",

    "changing, maybe love or solitude. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let me think about the structure. Wildenvey's poems often have a rhyme \n",

    "\n",
    "Okay, I'll start drafting some lines. Let me think about the seasons—maybe \n",

    "\n",
    "I need to make sure the Norwegian is correct, so perhaps using simple \n",

    "\n",
    "Let me try putting this together. Start with a scene in the forest during \n",
    "autumn. Use some sensory details—sight, sound, smell. Maybe personify \n",
    "elements of nature to give it that poetic touch.\n",
    "\n",
    "I should also include some emotional undertone, perhaps a sense of longing \n",
    "or peace. Maybe something about memories or the passage of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hmm, okay, so putting this into verse. I'll try to write a stanza and see \n",
    "how it flows. Then maybe expand from there, ensuring each stanza connects \n",
    "with the next thematically.\n",

    "I also need to make sure the poem isn't too long—maybe four stanzas? That \n",

From what I remember, he's a Norwegian poet known for his nature-themed poetry and his use of traditional forms. His work often reflects themes like solitude, nature, and sometimes has a melancholic feel.\n",

      "\n",
      "I need to decide on the theme. Since Wildenvey often writes about nature and solitude, maybe focusing on a natural setting would be good. Let's go with something like autumn, as it's rich in imagery and can evoke the emotions typical in his poetry.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, structure. Wildenvey sometimes uses quatrains (four-line stanzas) with a consistent rhyme scheme, often ABAB or ABBA. I should stick to that for consistency. Each stanza can focus on different aspects of nature or emotion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the language. It needs to be poetic and descriptive, using vivid imagery without being overly complex. Words like \"lykkenspill\" (chain of light) or \"vindenspore\" (whispering of the wind) can add that lyrical touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also want to convey a sense of introspection, something Wildenvey is known for. Maybe ending each stanza with a personal reflection or a feeling, like the echo of one's own voice in nature.\n",

      "Let me draft a few lines. Starting with setting the scene—autumnal imagery, then moving into the emotional aspect. I'll make sure each line flows naturally and maintains the rhythm.\n",

      "Alright, so I need to figure out how to generate the 2D heat equation using LaTeX code. Hmm, okay. Let's start by recalling what the heat equation is. From my studies, I remember that the heat equation describes how heat distributes itself over time in a given region. In one dimension, it's pretty straightforward—it involves the second derivative of temperature with respect to space and the first derivative with respect to time.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now, we're moving to two dimensions. So, instead of just one spatial variable, say x, we'll have two: maybe x and y. That makes sense because in 2D, heat can spread out in both directions. I think this means that the Laplacian operator comes into play since it deals with the sum of second derivatives in multiple dimensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, what exactly is the Laplacian? Oh right, in 2D Cartesian coordinates, the Laplacian of a function u(x, y, t) would be the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to x and y. So that's ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y². I should make sure I remember this correctly because getting it wrong could lead me astray.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, putting it all together, the heat equation in 2D would involve the time derivative of u on one side and the Laplacian multiplied by some constant (like thermal diffusivity) on the other. So, writing that out, it should be something like ∂u/∂t = α(∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y²), where α is the thermal diffusivity.\n",

      "Let me double-check if this makes sense dimensionally. The left side has units of temperature per time, and the right side has units of (temperature)/(length squared) multiplied by a constant with units of length squared over time—so overall, it's temperature per time on both sides. That checks out.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I also need to consider boundary conditions for a complete solution, but since the question just asks for the equation itself, maybe that's not necessary here.

      "Okay, so I need to generate the 2D heat equation using LaTeX. Hmm, let me think about where to start. I remember that the heat equation is a partial differential equation, right? It's used to describe how heat diffuses in space over time. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, I should recall the standard form of the heat equation. I think it's something like ∂u/∂t = Δu, where Δu represents the Laplace operator acting on u, which is a function of space variables x and y, and t is time. So in mathematical terms, that would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\nabla^2 u\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "But wait, I should express this with more explicit operators. The Laplace operator in 2D is the sum of the second derivatives with respect to x and y. So it's:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "\\nabla^2 u = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "So putting it all together, the heat equation becomes:\n",

      "\\[\n",
      "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, how should I present this in LaTeX? I think using display equations with the fraction and derivatives clearly shown would make it look good. So I'll use the equation environment and align them properly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, is there a difference between ∇² and writing out the second derivatives each time? I think for clarity, especially in 2D, it's better to write both partial derivatives. That way, readers can see exactly what terms are involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, I should make sure that the LaTeX code compiles correctly. Using \\frac{}{} for fractions and proper alignment with & might help. Let me structure it so that each term is on a separate line or aligned vertically if needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But looking back, maybe it's better to have all the partial derivatives on the same line for simplicity. So perhaps:\n",
      "\n",
      "\\[\n",
      "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial y^2}\n",
      "\\]\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, that looks clean. I can put this inside a single equation environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if I want to include the Laplace operator symbol ∇², it might look more professional. So:\n",

      "\\[\n",
      "\\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial t} = \\nabla^2 u\n",
      "\\]\n",

      "But since it's 2D, specifying the Laplacian in terms of x and y derivatives is also fine. I think both representations are correct, but perhaps the explicit form is clearer for those who might not be as familiar with the Laplace operator.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of LaTeX formatting, I should ensure that all partial derivatives are properly enclosed in \\frac{}{} or \\partial{}{} and that the superscripts are handled correctly with ^2. Also, variables like u, x, y, t should be italicized for proper notation.\n",
