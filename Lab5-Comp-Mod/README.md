# Lab 5: Computational modeling

This lab is part of our journey through computational modeling techniques, and the use of AI in biomedical applications. It is designed to give you a comprehensive understanding of how computational modelinhg is transforming society in general and biomedicine in particular and the role it will play in the future of biomedical research.<br>  _update: 2025-01-25_

## Your turn!

Spend some time playing around with the provided examples. You'll find some questions for you to investigate in the notebooks. If you're already familiar with medical imaging and image analysis you can try your hand at more advanced examples, or, even better, help out other less experienced team members.
