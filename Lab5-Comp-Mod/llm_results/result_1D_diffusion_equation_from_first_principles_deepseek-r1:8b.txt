Okay, so I need to derive the 1D diffusion equation from first principles. Hmm, where do I start? I remember that diffusion is about how particles spread out over time, like heat spreading or chemical concentration gradients. But I'm not exactly sure about the mathematical steps involved.

First, maybe I should recall some basics of partial differential equations because diffusion involves both spatial and temporal changes. The equation probably includes a second derivative in space and a first derivative in time since diffusion is influenced by the gradient (how fast particles are moving) and how that changes over time.

I think the diffusivity coefficient might be important here, which could depend on temperature or concentration. Maybe it's treated as a constant for this derivation? Let me assume it's a constant for simplicity unless specified otherwise.

So, let's denote the concentration of particles as \( u(x,t) \), where \( x \) is position and \( t \) is time. The idea is that the rate at which particles move from one point to another depends on the gradient of \( u \). I think this relates to Fick's law in diffusion theory.

In Fick's first law, the flux \( J \) is proportional to the negative gradient of concentration: \( J = -D \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \), where \( D \) is the diffusivity. But over time, the concentration changes as particles move, so we need to consider how this flux affects the change in concentration over time.

To get a differential equation, maybe I can write the continuity equation by integrating the flux over space. The total number of particles at time \( t \) should be conserved, so the rate of change of particles is zero: \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial J}{\partial x} \).

Substituting Fick's law into this gives \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \). That looks like the standard 1D diffusion equation: \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \).

Wait, but I should make sure about the signs and dimensions. The gradient is negative because particles move from high to low concentration. So when you take the derivative of flux with respect to \( x \), it becomes positive because Fick's law has a negative sign. Yeah, that makes sense.

I might also want to consider initial conditions and boundary conditions, but I think the question only asks for the PDE itself, not its solutions or specific applications. So maybe I just need to present the equation as \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \nabla_x^2 u \), where \( \nabla_x^2 \) is the Laplacian operator in one dimension.

Alternatively, using Leibniz notation, it's \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \frac{d^2u}{dx^2} \). Either way, both notations are correct depending on how you express the second derivative.

I should also mention that this equation describes how a small perturbation in concentration at a point will spread out over space and time due to diffusion. The term \( D \) determines how quickly the diffusion occursâ€”larger \( D \) means faster spreading.

So putting it all together, I start by assuming conservation of particles, express flux as proportional to negative gradient, integrate over space to get continuity equation, substitute into conservation law, and end up with the diffusion PDE. That seems logical. Let me write that out step-by-step in LaTeX now.

To derive the 1D diffusion equation from first principles, we begin by considering the conservation of particle number, which is a fundamental principle in diffusion processes.

**Step-by-Step Derivation:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( u(x,t) \) represent the concentration of particles at position \( x \) and time \( t \).
   - The flux \( J(x,t) \) represents the rate at which particles move across a small area perpendicular to \( x \).

2. **Fick's First Law:**
   - The flux is proportional to the negative gradient of concentration:
     \[
     J = -D \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}
     \]
     where \( D \) is the diffusivity coefficient.

3. **Conservation of Particles:**
   - The rate of change of particle concentration at a point is equal to the flux entering or leaving that point:
     \[
     \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial J}{\partial x}
     \]

4. **Substitute Fick's Law into Conservation Equation:**
   - Substitute \( J \) from Fick's law:
     \[
     \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = -\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(-D \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)
     \]
     Simplify the right-hand side:
     \[
     \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
     \]

5. **Resulting Diffusion Equation:**
   - The equation obtained is:
     \[
     \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \nabla_x^2 u
     \]
     where \( \nabla_x^2 \) denotes the Laplacian operator in one dimension, which can be expressed as:
     \[
     \nabla_x^2 u = \frac{d^2u}{dx^2}
     \]

**Final 1D Diffusion Equation:**
\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = D \frac{d^2u}{dx^2}
\]
This equation describes how the concentration of particles evolves over time due to diffusion processes, with \( D \) controlling the rate at which concentrations spread out spatially.
