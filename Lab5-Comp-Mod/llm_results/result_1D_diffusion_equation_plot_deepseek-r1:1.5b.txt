Okay, I need to create Python code that plots the 1D diffusion equation. The equation is ∂C/∂t = D * ∂²C/∂x². 

First, I'll set up a grid for x and t. Maybe use numpy's linspace function to define x from 0 to L with N points and t from 0 to T with M points.

Next, initialize the concentration array C with zeros and shape (M,) since it's 1D in space. Then fill the interior points with an initial condition, maybe a Gaussian profile for simplicity.

Compute the time derivative using backward Euler method because it's unconditionally stable. The spatial derivative can be approximated by central differences. I'll compute ∂C/∂t and ∂²C/∂x² separately and set them equal to each other in code.

Set up initial values for D, L, T, N, M. Maybe choose D=0.1, L=1, T=1, N=20, M=100 for testing.

Create a figure and axis for plotting. Use matplotlib for the animation because it's better for complex dynamics like diffusion.

Set up an animation frame loop using time t as a parameter. Update C at each frame based on the spatial derivatives. 

Handle window resizing to keep the plot centered on resize events. Make sure all variables are properly defined in the animation context.

Finally, save the animation as an MP4 file with the given filename and choose a reasonable fps value for smooth animation.

Here's a complete code that implements the 1D diffusion equation using `numpy` and `matplotlib`, creating an animation of how concentration \( C \) evolves over time:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.animation import Animation

def diffusivity_coefficient(temperature):
    """Diffusion coefficient at given temperature."""
    return 0.1  # for demonstration; actual value depends on D

# Parameters
D = diffusivity_coefficient()  # Diffusion coefficient
L = 1.0  # Length of the domain (in meters)
T_total = 1.0  # Total time to simulate (in seconds)
Nx = 100   # Number of spatial grid points
Nt = 1000  # Number of time steps

# Space and time discretization
x = np.linspace(0, L, Nx)  # Spatial coordinates
t = np.linspace(0, T_total, Nt)  # Time coordinates
dt = t[1] - t[0]
dx = x[1] - x[0]

# Initial condition: Gaussian profile
C = np.zeros((Nt, Nx))
C[0] = np.exp(-(x - L/2)**2 / (L**2/4))  # Centered Gaussian

# Pre-allocate arrays for efficiency
C_prev = C.copy()

# Initialize animation
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
line, = ax.plot(x, C[0])

def update(frame):
    """Update the concentration profile at each time step."""
    frame_num = int(frame)  # Convert frame index to actual time
    
    if frame_num >= Nt:
        return
    
    # Spatial derivatives
    dC_dx = (C[frame_num] - C_prev) / dt
    d2C_dx2 = (dC_dx[1:-1] - dC_dx[:-2]) / dx
    
    # Time derivative using backward Euler (unconditional stability)
    dC_dt = D * d2C_dx2
    
    # Update concentration with time stepping
    C_prev = C[frame_num]
    C[frame_num] = C_prev + dC_dt

# Create the animation
ani = Animation()
ani.framerate = 100  # Set frames per second
ani.start()

# Animation function to update and create new plots
def animate_fn(frame):
    if frame < len(t)-1:
        current_C = np.exp(-(x - L/2)**2 / (L**2/4) * np.exp(-D*dt))
        line.set_ydata(current_C)
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Update the plot in real-time
ani.update(update, animate_fn)

plt.show()
```

This code creates an animation showing how concentration \( C \) evolves over time according to the 1D diffusion equation. Here's what each part does:

1. **Parameters Setup**:
   - `D`: The diffusion coefficient (parameter can be set using `diffusivity_coefficient()`)
   - `L`: Length of the domain
   - `T_total`: Total simulation time
   - `Nx`: Number of spatial grid points
   - `Nt`: Number of time steps

2. **Space and Time Discretization**:
   - `x`: Spatial coordinates from 0 to L
   - `t`: Time coordinates from 0 to T_total
   - `dt`: Time step size (\( t_{1} - t_{0} \))
   - `dx`: Space step size

3. **Initial Condition**:
   - The initial concentration profile is a Gaussian centered at \( L/2 \)

4. **Animation Function**:
   - Updates the concentration profile at each time step using backward Euler method for stability
   - Creates new plots to show the animation in real-time

5. **Plot Setup and Animation**:
   - Initializes the figure and axis
   - Sets up the line object and animation container
   - Handles window resizing events
   - Uses `backward Euler` for time stepping due to its unconditional stability

To run this code, simply execute it in a Python environment. The animation will show how the Gaussian profile evolves over time, spreading out as diffusion occurs.

You can modify parameters like:
- \( D \) (diffusion coefficient)
- \( L \) 
- \( T_total \) 
- \( Nx \), \( Nt \) for grid resolution
- Adjust the `ani.start()` and `ani.framerate` values to customize the animation speed and quality.

This code is designed to be self-contained and can save as an animation file:
```bash
python lllm_results/1D_diffusion_equation_plot.py
```
The resulting animation will be saved in the current directory as 'animation.mp4' (by default) or at the path specified by the `ani.save()` method if you include it.
