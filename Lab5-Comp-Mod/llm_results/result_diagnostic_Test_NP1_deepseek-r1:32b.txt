Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the most likely diagnosis for Anna based on the information given. Let me break down her case step by step.

Anna is 10 years old and has delayed development. She started walking at 2 years old, which seems a bit late since typical milestones have children walking around 12-15 months. Then she began speaking in short sentences at 4 years old; normally, kids start forming simple sentences around 2-3 years, so this is also behind.

Her IQ was measured as 68 when she started school. That's below the average range (which is typically considered to be between 90-110). An IQ of 68 would fall into the borderline or mild intellectual disability category depending on the assessment tool used.

She has difficulties with reading, writing, and math. These are academic challenges that can stem from various issues, but given her developmental delays, it could relate to cognitive impairments affecting learning.

Anna needs continuous support both in the classroom and daily activities. This suggests she requires a structured environment and assistance to function effectively in different settings.

She has trouble understanding social rules and norms and struggles to form and maintain friendships. Social skill deficits are common in certain conditions like autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but they can also be present in other developmental disorders.

She's participating in special education where she gets tailored teaching and support to promote learning and development. Special education services often target specific needs, which aligns with various diagnoses that require such interventions.

Her adaptive functioning at home is weak. Adaptive skills include daily living skills like dressing, eating, personal hygiene, etc. Weakness here could indicate difficulties in performing these tasks independently.

Now, considering all this, the possible diagnoses could be:

1. Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder): Given her IQ score and delays in development, this seems a strong possibility. Intellectual disabilities affect both intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior, which fits Anna's profile.

2. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD): The social difficulties and repetitive behaviors are classic signs of ASD, but without information on restricted interests or repetitive behaviors, it's harder to confirm. However, she could have both ASD and an intellectual disability.

3. Specific Learning Disorders: Her struggles with reading, writing, and math could point to specific learning disabilities like dyslexia, dysgraphia, or dyscalculia. But these are usually not accompanied by the broader developmental delays and social difficulties Anna has.

4. Developmental Delay without a specific diagnosis: Sometimes, children have global delays that don't fit neatly into a specific category, but given her IQ score and other factors, an intellectual disability seems more likely.

Given that she needs special education and continuous support across settings, along with the IQ score and adaptive challenges, Intellectual Disability is the most probable diagnosis. It's possible that she also has ASD if social communication issues persist, but without more details on ASD-specific symptoms, Intellectual Disability stands out as the primary concern.

The most likely diagnosis for Anna is **Intellectual Disability (Intellectual Developmental Disorder)**. This conclusion is supported by her delayed developmental milestones, low IQ score of 68, difficulties with academic skills, and challenges in adaptive functioning. While Autism Spectrum Disorder could be a consideration due to social difficulties, the information provided does not specify ASD-specific symptoms like restricted interests or repetitive behaviors. Therefore, Intellectual Disability aligns most closely with Anna's profile, encompassing her cognitive and adaptive challenges.
