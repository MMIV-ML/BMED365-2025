Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the most likely diagnosis for Anna, who is 10 years old and has been experiencing delayed development. Let me start by going through all the information given.

Anna is 10 years old but has not met some milestones. She started walking at 2 years old, which is a bit later than typical. She began speaking in short sentences around 4, which might be a little later than usual, though it can vary. Her IQ is measured at 68 when she started school, which is a bit lower than the average of 100, but I'm not sure what the implications are for her specifically.

She has problems with reading, writing, and arithmetic. She needs continuous support both in the classroom and in daily activities. Understanding social rules and norms is difficult for her, and she struggles to form and maintain friendships. She's involved in special education programs where they adapt her learning and provide extra support to help her progress.

At home, she has some adaptive functions, but I'm not exactly sure what that means in this context. Maybe it refers to her ability to perform daily tasks with some assistance or adjustments.

I'm trying to think about the possible diagnoses here. Delayed speech and language development could point towards several conditions like speech delay, language delay, or even something like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The IQ of 68 suggests she might have an intellectual disability, but I also know that IQ tests aren't always the only indicator.

Her difficulties with reading, writing, and arithmetic could be indicative of a learning disability. She might have a phonetic or surface-level reading issue, which is more about decoding words rather than understanding text. Or it could be something like a working memory issue, which affects arithmetic performance.

Social skills are another area where she's having trouble. Difficulty following social norms and forming friendships suggests issues with social communication. This makes me think of conditions related to social communication disorder or ASD, as both can present with challenges in these areas.

She is receiving special undervisning (which I think is similar to special education), so the support she's getting might be tailored for her specific needs. The fact that her home situation allows for some adaptive functions suggests she has the potential for growth and learning but maybe within a supported environment.

Putting this together, Anna might have a combination of issues. She could have an intellectual disability alongside a learning disability and social communication difficulties. These are often comorbid conditions, especially in children with autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.

Alternatively, her IQ being 68 could fall under the criteria for intellectual disability, which is defined as having significant limitations in intellectual functioning that affect daily living. This could be accompanied by adaptive behavior deficits, but I'm not sure how that applies here.

I should also consider if there are any motor or sensory issues that might contribute to her delays. For example, if she has motor speech delay, it could explain her late development in speech. But the information doesn't specify this, so maybe it's not relevant.

Another angle is to think about sensory processing difficulties. Sometimes, children with certain sensory issues can have delayed language and social skills development because they might be overwhelmed by sensory input or struggle to process it properly.

Given that she's in special education and receiving tailored support, the diagnosis would likely involve a team assessment that includes her IQ, academic performance, social skills, and any adaptive behaviors. It's important to rule out other conditions before settling on a diagnosis but given the combination of factors, an intellectual disability with learning difficulties and social communication issues seems plausible.

I also need to consider if there are any other possible diagnoses, like ADHD, which can affect attention, organization, and social behavior. However, I don't see specific mention of hyperactivity or inattention, so that's less likely unless it's a comorbid condition with another disorder.

In summary, the most likely diagnosis seems to be a combination of intellectual disability, learning disabilities (specifically reading and arithmetic), and difficulties in social communication. These could be related to conditions like ASD or other neurodevelopmental disorders.

The most likely diagnosis for Anna is a combination of several conditions:

1. **Intellectual Disability**: Defined by her IQ of 68, which falls below average and may indicate significant limitations in intellectual functioning that affect daily living.

2. **Learning Disabilities**: Specifically, she exhibits difficulties with reading, writing, and arithmetic. This could include phonetic or surface-level reading issues, as well as potential working memory problems affecting arithmetic performance.

3. **Social Communication Difficulties**: She struggles with understanding social norms and forming friendships, which aligns with conditions like Social Communication Disorder or aspects of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

4. **Potential Comorbid Conditions**: The possibility of comorbidities such as ADHD, which could impact attention and organization skills, though inattention isn't specifically mentioned.

5. **Sensory Processing Issues**: There may be underlying sensory processing difficulties contributing to her delayed language and social skills development.

Given this comprehensive assessment, Anna's diagnosis would likely involve a team evaluation focusing on these areas, suggesting a combination of intellectual disability with learning and social communication challenges, potentially related to neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD.
