Okay, so I need to write a poem in the style of Herman Wildenvey in Norwegian. I'm not too familiar with him, but I know he's a Norwegian poet known for his nature themes and emotional depth. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should probably recall some characteristics of Wildenvey's poetry. He often writes about landscapes, emotions, and the interplay between human experience and nature. His style is usually melancholic and reflective, with rich imagery.

I need to make sure I use Norwegian language elements correctly. Maybe start by brainstorming some natural scenes that resonate emotionally—like mountains, forests, or maybe a lonely setting where someone is contemplating their thoughts.

I should think about the structure. Wildenvey's poems can vary in form, but they often have a flowing rhythm and a focus on imagery over strict meter. I'll aim for free verse with vivid descriptions.

Next, emotions. Sadness, longing, perhaps nostalgia are common themes. Maybe include elements like wind, silence, or shadows to evoke those feelings.

I should also consider the setting. Norway's nature is vast and varied— fjords, mountains, forests. Maybe pick a specific scene that can encapsulate both beauty and melancholy.

Let me think of some lines. Start with an image from nature, then transition into emotional reflection. For example, "The mountain stands alone" could lead to thoughts about solitude or time passing.

I need to make sure the poem flows naturally in Norwegian. I might have to adjust word order for poetic effect and use appropriate vocabulary that conveys the intended mood without being too literal.

Perhaps include metaphors or personifications—like the wind whispering secrets or shadows holding memories. These can add depth to the imagery.

Also, consider the ending. It should leave a lingering feeling, maybe with an unresolved thought or a moment of reflection that ties back to the natural scene described.

Let me try putting some ideas together. Start with setting the scene, then introduce the emotions, use nature elements as metaphors, and conclude with a reflective note.

Wait, I might need to check if my Norwegian is accurate. I should ensure that the vocabulary and grammar are correct so that the poem makes sense and flows well.

Alternatively, maybe look for inspiration from existing Wildenvey poems in translation to get a better sense of his style and apply it here.

I think I have a rough outline now: set the scene with a natural image, introduce emotional elements through personified nature, build up reflections or memories, and conclude with a thoughtful ending that ties everything together.

Let me draft some lines in Norwegian, focusing on these elements. Make sure each stanza transitions smoothly into the next, maintaining the melancholic yet beautiful tone Wildenvey is known for.

**Målet i Skogen**

I skogens dybde står et trær,  
hvis røtter gruber seg i tidens stol,  
med lovmark og kryssinger, som er skrevet av vindene.  

Hver bladspenne fliser i solen,  
men under skumringen skjuler de hemmeligheter,  
som kun fugler og muldvarer forstår.

Jeg går på stien som snuser seg inn,  
hvor stenenes ansikter minker min farverom.  
Hver trinns lyd er en viskende henvisselse til det som var.

Droppen på frøet prøver å bygge et rike,  
som fugler flyr over marken,  
og skyggeriene持ber seg over jorden, som en uspist sang.

Hvem skal fortelle historien om disse stedene?  
Om vinden som blåser forbi, og de tomme plassene de etterlaster.  
Jeg står her og lytter til det som ikke sier noe,  

til det dybe i skogen,  
der trærne vokser mot himelen,  
og jordens andedrett er så tydelig at jeg kan føle den i lommen min.

Så jeg glemmer meg en stund,  
i det store som omgir meg,  
og tiden står still mens jeg监er over dødsfallen og levende.
