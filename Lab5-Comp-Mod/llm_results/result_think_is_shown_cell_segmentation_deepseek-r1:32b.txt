Cell segmentation is the process of dividing a population of cells into distinct groups or categories based on specific characteristics, such as size, shape, fluorescence intensity, or other measurable features. This technique is widely used in various fields, including biology, medicine, and cytometry, to analyze and sort cells for research, diagnosis, or therapeutic purposes.

### Key Steps in Cell Segmentation:
1. **Image Acquisition**: Capture high-quality images of the cell population using microscopy or flow cytometry.
2. **Preprocessing**: Enhance image quality by adjusting brightness, contrast, or applying filters to improve feature detection.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Identify specific features of interest, such as size, shape, texture, or fluorescence intensity.
4. **Segmentation**: Use algorithms (e.g., thresholding, clustering, or machine learning) to group cells based on their features.
5. **Analysis and Sorting**: Analyze the segmented groups for further study or sort them for downstream applications.

### Applications:
- **Flow Cytometry**: Used to separate cells based on size, granularity, and fluorescence.
- **Immunology**: Helps in identifying and isolating specific immune cell subsets.
- **Cancer Research**: Assists in distinguishing cancerous from healthy cells.
- **Stem Cell Research**: Aids in purifying stem cell populations for regenerative medicine.

Cell segmentation is a powerful tool that enables precise analysis and manipulation of cellular populations, advancing both research and clinical applications.
