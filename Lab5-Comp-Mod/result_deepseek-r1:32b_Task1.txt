Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the most likely diagnosis for this 6-month-old baby with a rash on both cheeks and the chin. Let me break down what I know from the question.

First, the mother is a family doctor herself, which might mean she's observant about her child's health but not necessarily an expert in pediatrics or dermatology. The baby is otherwise healthy, so that rules out some systemic diseases. But let's focus on the rash.

The rash started developing over the last 6 weeks. It's erythematous, meaning it's red, and maculopapular, which means flat red spots (macules) and small raised bumps (papules). There are also excoriations, which suggests the baby is scratching or rubbing the area. The rash is on both cheeks and the chin.

Since it's a child under one year old with facial erythema and papules, I should think about common rashes in that age group. Baby acne comes to mind because it often presents as small red bumps on the face, especially around the cheeks and nose. But baby acne usually starts within the first few weeks of life, not at 6 months. Also, baby acne doesn't typically cause excoriations unless the baby is scratching a lot.

Another possibility is eczema, or atopic dermatitis. Eczema can present with red, itchy patches on the face and cheeks. It often starts in infancy and can lead to excoriation if the child scratches. But eczema usually presents as dry, scaly patches rather than papules. However, sometimes it can have a more erythematous and raised appearance.

Contact dermatitis is another thought. If the baby is using a new product or coming into contact with something irritating, like a detergent or skincare product, it could cause a red, itchy rash. But the question doesn't mention any changes in products or environment.

Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic condition that causes blisters and itching, but I think it's less common in such young children and might present more with vesicles rather than erythematous macules.

Roseola is a viral infection that typically presents with fever followed by a rash on the trunk and sometimes the face. But since this has been going on for 6 weeks, and roseola usually resolves within a week or two, that might not fit.

Contact eczema could be possible if there's an allergen involved, but again, without more info on exposure, it's hard to confirm.

Wait, another thought: perioral dermatitis. It’s common around the mouth in adults but can occur in children too. It presents as red papules around the mouth and sometimes the face. However, I'm not sure how common it is in 6-month-olds compared to older kids or adults.

Also, consider slapped cheek syndrome (fifth disease). That causes a bright red rash on the cheeks with a slapped appearance. But usually, that's acute and accompanied by fever in some cases. This has been ongoing for weeks, so maybe not.

Another possibility is heat rash or miliaria, but that typically presents as small bumps, sometimes itchy, especially in areas prone to sweating like the face. However, it might not explain the erythema as described.

I'm also thinking about fungal infections, like candidiasis, which can cause a red, scaly rash around the mouth or other areas where skin is moist. But again, without more info on the appearance and if there's any scaling, it's hard to say.

Wait, let me go back. The baby is 6 months old, has a facial rash for 6 weeks, erythematous maculopapular with excoriations. So the key points are: age, location (face), duration, and signs of scratching.

Putting it all together, atopic dermatitis seems plausible because it's common in infants, affects the face, can be chronic, and leads to itching. The erythema and papules could fit if it's an acute flare. Alternatively, baby acne might still be a possibility even though it starts earlier; sometimes it can persist longer.

But wait, contact eczema or irritant dermatitis is another angle—maybe the baby is using a new skincare product or something that's irritating the skin on the face and chin. That could explain the erythematous papules and excoriations from itching.

Another consideration: seborrheic dermatitis in infants, which presents as a scaly, red rash on the scalp (cradle cap) but can also affect the face, including the cheeks and eyebrows. It might not present exactly as described here since it's more about scaling, but sometimes there's erythema.

I'm trying to remember what each condition looks like. Atopic dermatitis often has dry, scaly patches that are red, and the baby would be very itchy. Baby acne is more about small pustules or papules without much scaling. Contact dermatitis would have a more defined area where the irritant touches the skin, but in this case, it's on both cheeks and chin—maybe from drooling or something else.

Given that the rash has been present for 6 weeks, it's probably chronic rather than acute. So atopic dermatitis is more likely to be chronic, whereas contact dermatitis can be either depending on exposure.

Alternatively, could it be a type of viral exanthem? But those are usually acute and associated with fever or other symptoms.

In summary, considering the age, location, duration, erythematous maculopapular rash, and excoriations, the most likely diagnosis is atopic dermatitis. However, I should also consider contact eczema if there's a potential irritant involved. Baby acne is possible but usually starts earlier.

The most likely diagnosis for the 6-month-old baby with a persistent erythematous maculopapular rash on the cheeks and chin, accompanied by excoriations, is **atopic dermatitis**. This condition is common in infants, often presents chronically, and can cause red, itchy patches on the face. While other possibilities such as contact eczema or baby acne were considered, atopic dermatitis best fits the described symptoms of chronicity, location, and presence of scratching.
