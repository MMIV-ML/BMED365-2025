Okay, so I need to derive the 1D diffusion equation from first principles. Hmm, where do I start? I remember that diffusion is about how particles move from an area of high concentration to low concentration over time. So it's like a spread out process.

First, maybe I should consider the basic idea of concentration gradients and how they change over time. Let me think about Fick's law of diffusion. From what I recall, Fick's first law states that the flux J is proportional to the negative gradient of concentration, so J = -D∇c, where D is the diffusion coefficient.

But wait, since we're dealing with one dimension here, this simplifies things a lot. Let me denote the position as x and time as t. So, in 1D, the gradient ∇c would just be dc/dx. That means Fick's first law becomes J = -D*(dc/dx). But what is J? Flux is the amount of substance passing through a given area per unit time. In a small interval Δx at position x, the flux out of that section would be J*Δx.

Now, considering a small volume element at position x with thickness dx and length L (assuming L is constant for simplicity), the change in concentration over time dt should be related to the flux leaving or entering that volume. If I take the total amount of substance N in that volume, which is c*L*dx, then the change dN/dt would be the net flux through the boundaries minus any other processes like chemical reactions. But since we're focusing on diffusion alone, let's ignore reactions for now.

So, the net rate of change of concentration c at position x is the negative derivative of N with respect to time, which gives:

∂c/∂t = - (J* L)/L = -J

Wait, that seems confusing. Let me think again. If J is the flux, then the amount leaving per unit time is J*dx. So for a small volume dx*L, the change in concentration over time would be:

dc/dt = -(J/L) * (1/Δx) * ΔN

Hmm, I might be complicating things. Let me try another approach. The rate of change of concentration at position x is equal to the flux leaving that point divided by the volume. Since we're in 1D and considering a small length dx, the volume element would be L*dx, where L is the unit length.

So, writing this out:

∂c/∂t = - (J / (L * dx)) * (2A * dx)

Wait, that doesn't seem right. I think I'm mixing up some terms here. Let me take a step back.

Fick's first law is J = -D*(dc/dx). So the flux leaving a point x is proportional to the gradient of concentration at that point. The idea is that particles move from high to low concentration, so the flux is directed opposite to the concentration gradient.

Now, considering a small section at position x with thickness dx. The number of particles in this section is approximately c(x) * L * dx, where L is the length of the system. The change in the number of particles in time dt is dN = -J * (L * dx) * dt. This negative sign comes from Fick's law, as particles are leaving the section.

So the change in concentration at position x would be:

dc/dt ≈ (-J * L * dt) / (L * dx)

Simplifying this, the L cancels out, so we have:

∂c/∂t = - J / dx

But from Fick's law, J = -D*(dc/dx). Substituting this into the equation:

∂c/∂t = - (-D*(dc/dx)) / dx = D*(dc/dx)/dx

So,

∂c/∂t = D*(d²c/dx²)

That gives us the diffusion equation:

∂c/∂t = D * ∇²c

Which is the standard form of the 1D diffusion equation. Wait, but I think I missed a negative sign somewhere. Let me check again.

In Fick's law, J = -D*(dc/dx). So substituting into dc/dt:

dc/dt ≈ (J / dx) because the flux is leaving, so it's positive when considering concentration decreasing over time? Wait, no. If particles are leaving, c decreases, so dc/dt should be negative.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign earlier. Let me re-examine the derivation carefully.

Starting from Fick's first law:

J = -D*(dc/dx)

At position x, the flux is J exiting to the right (assuming positive x direction). The number of particles leaving the volume element per unit time is J*L*dx. So the concentration c decreases over time, so:

dN/dt = -J * L * dx

Then,

d(cLdx)/dt = dc/dt * L * dx

So,

dc/dt * L * dx = -J * L * dx

Dividing both sides by L*dx:

dc/dt = -J / dx

Now substitute J from Fick's law:

dc/dt = -(-D*(dc/dx)) / dx = D*(dc/dx)/dx

Thus,

∂c/∂t = D*(d²c/dx²)

Yes, that looks correct. So the equation is ∂c/∂t = D*(d²c/dx²), which can also be written as:

∂c/∂t = D*(∇²c)

Since we're in 1D, ∇²c is just d²c/dx².

So putting it all together, the derivation comes from considering the flux due to concentration gradients and how that affects the rate of change of concentration over time. The result is a partial differential equation where the rate of change of concentration is proportional to the second derivative of concentration with respect to space, scaled by the diffusion coefficient D.

The 1D diffusion equation can be derived from first principles by considering the relationship between the flux of particles and the concentration gradient over time.

**Step-by-Step Derivation:**

1. **Fick's First Law:** The flux \( J \) (particles per unit time) is proportional to the negative concentration gradient:
   \[
   J = -D \frac{\partial c}{\partial x}
   \]
   where \( D \) is the diffusion coefficient.

2. **Flux Through a Small Volume Element:** Consider a small volume element of length \( dx \) at position \( x \). The number of particles in this element is approximately:
   \[
   N = c(x, t) \cdot L \cdot dx
   \]
   where \( L \) is the unit length of the system.

3. **Rate of Change of Concentration:** The change in the number of particles over time \( dt \) due to diffusion is given by:
   \[
   dN = -J \cdot L \cdot dx \cdot dt
   \]
   (negative sign indicates particles leaving the element).

4. **Expressing Change in Concentration:**
   \[
   c(x, t) \cdot L \cdot dx \cdot dt = -J \cdot L \cdot dx \cdot dt
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \( L \cdot dx \cdot dt \):
   \[
   \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = -\frac{J}{dx}
   \]

5. **Substitute Flux from Fick's Law:**
   \[
   J = -D \frac{\partial c}{\partial x}
   \]
   Substituting into the equation:
   \[
   \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = -\frac{-D \frac{\partial c}{\partial x}}{dx} = D \frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial x^2}
   \]

6. **Final Result:** The partial differential equation governing the concentration \( c(x, t) \) is:
   \[
   \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial x^2}
   \]
   
This is the 1D diffusion equation.

```latex
The 1D diffusion equation is given by:

\[
\frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = D \frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial x^2}
\]

where \( c(x, t) \) is the concentration of the substance at position \( x \) and time \( t \), and \( D \) is the diffusion coefficient.
