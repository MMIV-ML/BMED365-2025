Okay, so I need to figure out how to plot the 1D diffusion equation using Python. The equation is given as ∂c/∂t = D * ∂²c/∂x². Hmm, right. I remember that this is a partial differential equation describing how a concentration c changes over time t in one dimension x.

First, I think about what the equation represents. It's similar to heat diffusion, where the rate of change of temperature (concentration here) at a point is proportional to the negative gradient of temperature (concentration), with the proportionality constant D being the thermal diffusivity. So, this is analogous to how heat spreads out over time.

Now, to plot this, I probably need to solve the PDE numerically because it's difficult to find an analytical solution for arbitrary initial and boundary conditions. Maybe I can use a finite difference method or some kind of implicit solver.

I should start by considering the domain. Let's assume it's from x = 0 to x = L, where L is the length of the system. The time domain could be from t=0 to t=T, where T is the total time we want to simulate up to.

Next, I need to discretize the space and time variables. For that, I can introduce spatial steps Δx and temporal steps Δt. Let's say we use n_x points in the x-direction and n_t points in the t-direction. So, the grid would have n_x - 1 intervals in x and n_t - 1 intervals in t.

The key idea is to discretize the PDE into a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that can be solved using methods like the forward Euler, backward Euler, or more accurate schemes like Runge-Kutta. Since this is a parabolic equation, maybe an implicit method would be better to avoid stability issues.

I recall that for the 1D heat equation, Crank-Nicolson method is often used because it's implicit and has good stability properties. Maybe I can apply a similar approach here since the diffusion equation resembles the heat equation with D replacing the thermal diffusivity.

Let me write down the finite difference approximation of the PDE. The second derivative in x would be approximated using central differences:

∂²c/∂x² ≈ (c(x+Δx, t) - 2c(x, t) + c(x-Δx, t)) / (Δx)^2.

Then, substituting into the PDE:

∂c/∂t = D * [ (c(x+Δx, t) - 2c(x, t) + c(x-Δx, t)) / (Δx)^2 ]

Which can be rewritten as:

c(x, t + Δt) ≈ c(x, t) + D * (h^2) [ c(x+Δx, t) - 2c(x, t) + c(x-Δx, t) ] 

Here, I used h = Δx. This is a forward Euler scheme but with the second derivative approximation.

But if I want to use an implicit method like Crank-Nicolson, I need to rearrange terms:

c(x, t + Δt) - c(x, t) = D * h² [ c(x+Δx, t) - 2c(x, t) + c(x-Δx, t) ]

Then, the equation can be written as:

c(x, t + Δt) = (1 - D h² / 2) c(x, t) + D h² [ c(x+Δx, t) + c(x-Δx, t) ] / 2

This is an implicit equation because c(x, t + Δt) appears on both sides.

So, for each time step, I can use this relation to compute the new concentration values at all grid points based on the old values. This approach avoids explicit solving of the ODE and uses a trapezoidal rule-like update for the second derivative.

Now, let me think about initializing the problem. Suppose we have an initial condition c(x, 0) = c₀(x). We can set this as the starting point at t=0. The boundary conditions will also be needed; maybe I'll assume that the concentration is zero at x=0 and x=L or some other conditions depending on what's required.

To implement this in Python, I can use numpy for array operations to handle the spatial discretization efficiently. Also, loops might be necessary if the number of grid points is large, but vectorized operations are more efficient.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Define constants: D, Δx (h), Δt, domain limits (x from 0 to L), and time limits (t from 0 to T).
2. Initialize the grid for x and t.
3. Set initial condition for c at t=0.
4. Apply boundary conditions if any.
5. Set up the Crank-Nicolson method parameters: coefficient (1 - D h² / 2) and the other term (D h² / 2).
6. Iterate over time steps, updating the concentration grid using the implicit formula.

Wait, but in code, it's better to represent everything as arrays. So I'll need to create two copies of the concentration array: one for the current time step and one for the next.

Let me think about the data structures:

- cx will hold the concentration at the current time.
- nx will be the number of grid points in x-direction, so we have nx+2 points (including boundaries) if using zero-based indexing. Hmm, but perhaps it's better to use 1-based for easier calculations.

Alternatively, I can pad the arrays with zeroth and n+1 points as ghost cells for boundary conditions. That might be necessary for applying Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions.

Yes, so maybe I should create a grid that includes x=0 and x=L as boundaries. For example, if my spatial grid is from x=0 to x=L with step Δx, then the array indices can go from 1 to n+1 (if n is the number of interior points).

In Python, for efficiency, I'll use numpy arrays. Let me sketch how this would look.

I'll have:

import numpy as np

L = 1.0
N = 100  # Number of grid points in x-direction
h = L / (N + 1)  # Because we include two ghost points at 0 and L.
x = h * np.arange(N + 2)

# Initialize concentration array with size N+2, including boundaries.
cx = np.zeros(N + 2)
# Apply boundary conditions. Suppose c(0,t)=c(L,t)=0:
if BC is Dirichlet (c=0 at x=0 and x=L):
    cx[1] = 0
    cx[N+1] = 0

Then, define initial condition in the middle. For example, if c(x,0) = 1 at x=0.5:
cx[mid_idx] = 1

Now, set up time stepping.

T = 0.1
Nt = 100  # Number of time steps
dt = T / Nt

coefficient = 1 - D * h**2 / 2
other_term = D * h**2 / 2

Then, in a loop over time steps:

for t_step in range(Nt):
    # Copy current concentration to next concentrations
    cn = coefficient * cx + other_term * (cx[1:-1].max() - 2*cx[1:-1] + cx[-1])
    
Wait, no. Because in the Crank-Nicolson formula, we have:

cn = (1 - D h² / 2) * cx + D h² [ c(x+Δx) + c(x-Δx) ] / 2

But cn is computed as:

cn[x] = (1 - D h² / 2) * cx[x] + D h² / 2 * (cx[x+1] + cx[x-1])

Except at the boundaries, where x=0 and x=L. At x=0, cn[0] remains zero (if Dirichlet), so:

cn = coefficient * cx + other_term * ( cx[1:-1].max() - 2*cx[1:-1] + cx[-1] )

Wait, no, let me see.

Actually, for each point in x, the update is:

cn[x] = coefficient * cx[x] + other_term * [ cx[x+1] + cx[x-1] ] / 2

But for x=0 and x=L, we have boundary conditions. So:

if BC is Dirichlet (c=0 at x=0 and x=L):
    cn[0] = 0
    cn[N+1] = 0
else:
    compute normally.

Wait, so in the code, I need to loop over each interior point, compute their new value based on neighboring points. But for boundary points, set them to zero.

In Python, perhaps using list comprehensions or vectorized operations would help.

Alternatively, I can represent cn as a copy of coefficient * cx + other_term times the average of the neighbors, except at boundaries where it's zero.

So:

cn = np.zeros_like(cx)
for i in range(1, N+2):
    if i == 0 or i == N+1:
        cn[i] = 0
    else:
        cn[i] = coefficient * cx[i] + other_term * (cx[i-1] + cx[i+1]) / 2

Wait, but in code, that's going to be slow if I loop through each point. So perhaps vectorize it.

Alternatively, note that the update is:

cn = coefficient * cx + other_term * ( (cx[1:-1].max() - 2*cx[1:-1] + cx[-1]) / 1 )

Wait, no, because for x=0 and x=N+1, their values are zero. For the interior points, it's:

cn[1:-1] = coefficient * cx[1:-1] + other_term * (cx[2] + cx[N])/2

But wait, in 1-based indexing, x ranges from 1 to N+1.

Wait, maybe better to handle it as follows:

Create a temporary array that holds the sum of the left and right neighbors for each interior point.

But I think the code can be written as:

cn = np.zeros_like(cx)
interior_points = slice(1, -1)
sum_neighbors = (cx[2] + cx[-1]) / 2
# But wait, that's only for x=1. Wait no.

Wait, actually, each interior point i has left neighbor i-1 and right neighbor i+1.

So the update for cn[i] is:

cn[i] = coefficient * cx[i] + other_term * (cx[i-1] + cx[i+1]) / 2

for i from 1 to N+1.

But at boundaries, set to zero.

Therefore, perhaps use a mask or loop through all points except boundaries.

Alternatively, in code:

# Compute the interior values
interior = np.zeros_like(cx)
for i in range(1, N+2):
    if i == 0 or i == N+1:
        interior[i] = 0
    else:
        interior[i] = coefficient * cx[i] + other_term * (cx[i-1] + cx[i+1]) / 2

But again, for large N, this is slow.

Alternatively, perhaps using vector operations.

Wait, but in Python, loops are not as fast as in compiled code. So maybe a better approach is needed.

Perhaps precompute the left and right shifts, then multiply by other_term, add to coefficient*cx, assign to cn, except at boundaries.

Yes:

left_shift = np.roll(cx, -1)
right_shift = np.roll(cx, 1)

Then, compute the sum of left and right shifted arrays, divided by 2.

But wait, for each interior point i, the sum is left_shift[i] + right_shift[i], but need to exclude boundaries.

Alternatively, perhaps create a mask where points are not on the boundary.

So:

# Compute the contributions from neighbors
sum_neighbors = (left_shift[1:-1] + right_shift[1:-1]) / 2

Then, cn = coefficient * cx + other_term * sum_neighbors

But wait, the boundaries in left_shift and right_shift would have been filled by the roll. So for x=0, after rolling, it's filled with cx[-1], which is problematic.

Wait, no, because when you roll an array of size N+2 to the left or right, points beyond 0 or N+1 are lost. Wait, no, actually, in Python, roll handles it by wrapping around?

No, actually, numpy doesn't wrap around with roll, it just extends the array with the last element. So rolling cx with shift=1 would make x=0 become cx[1], and the last element remains.

Wait, let me test:

import numpy as np

a = np.array([0., 1., 2., 3.])
print(np.roll(a, -1))  # shifts left by 1
# Output: [2. 0. 1. 3.]
print(np.roll(a, 1))   # shifts right by 1
# Output: [3. 0. 1. 2.]

Wait, so if you roll a with shift=-1 (left), the first element becomes the second, and the last element wraps around to the first position.

So for x=0 in left_shift would be cx[-1], which is x=N+1, because np.roll is cyclic.

Similarly, right_shift at x=0 would have cx[1].

But in our case, we don't want to include the boundary points when computing sum_neighbors. So perhaps:

sum_neighbors = (left_shift[1:-1] + right_shift[1:-1]) / 2

Yes, because for left_shift, which is shifted left by 1, the interior points become i-1 neighbors.

Similarly, right_shift, shifted right by 1, the interior becomes i+1 neighbors.

So:

sum_neighbors = (left_shift[1:-1] + right_shift[1:-1]) / 2

Then, cn can be computed as:

cn = np.zeros_like(cx)
interior_indices = slice(1, -1)

# For interior points
cn[interior_indices] = coefficient * cx[interior_indices] + other_term * sum_neighbors

But wait, left_shift and right_shift are already shifted arrays. So maybe the code can be:

sum_neighbors = (np.roll(cx, -1)[1:-1] + np.roll(cx, 1)[1:-1]) / 2
cn = coefficient * cx + other_term * sum_neighbors

Wait, is that correct?

Let me think: For each interior point i (not boundary), left_shift[i] would be cx[i-1], and right_shift[i] would be cx[i+1].

So yes, when you shift cx to the left by 1, then for interior points, the value at i is the previous point. Similarly, shifting right, the value at i is next point.

Therefore:

sum_neighbors = (left_shift[1:-1] + right_shift[1:-1]) / 2

So cn = coefficient * cx + other_term * sum_neighbors

But since we are only updating interior points and leaving boundaries as zero, that can be handled by the initial assignment of zeros in cn.

Yes, this seems correct. So:

# Compute left and right shifts
left_shift = np.roll(cx, -1)
right_shift = np.roll(cx, 1)

# Sum neighbors for interior points
sum_neighbors = (left_shift[1:-1] + right_shift[1:-1]) / 2

# Update cn with the computed values
cn = coefficient * cx + other_term * sum_neighbors

But wait, in this case, cn is a new array where:

- For boundary points (0 and N+1), cn is zero.

- For interior points, it's the coefficient times original plus other term times average of neighbors.

Yes, because when we do left_shift[1:-1], we exclude boundaries on the left. Similarly for right_shift[1:-1].

Therefore, this should give us the correct cn array.

Testing with a small example: let’s say N=2 (points 0,1,2).

cx = np.array([u, v, w])

left_shift = roll left by 1: [w, u, v]

right_shift = roll right by 1: [v, w, u]

sum_neighbors for interior points (only point 1):

= (left_shift[1] + right_shift[1]) /2

= (u + w)/2

So cn[0]=0, cn[1]=(coefficient * v) + other_term*(u + w)/2, cn[2]=0.

Which is correct.

Yes, this should work. So the code can be written as:

def compute_cn(coefficient, other_term, cx):
    # Compute left and right shifts
    left_shift = np.roll(cx, -1)
    right_shift = np.roll(cx, 1)
    
    # Sum neighbors for interior points
    sum_neighbors = (left_shift[1:-1] + right_shift[1:-1]) / 2
    
    # Update cn with the computed values
    cn = coefficient * cx + other_term * sum_neighbors
    return cn

But wait, in Python, when you do np.roll, it creates a new array, so we have to ensure that.

Testing this function:

Suppose cx is an array of shape (3), and then cn should be computed correctly.

Another test case: if N=1, which has points 0 and 1. But wait, in our code, slice [1:-1] for N=2 would exclude point 0 and 2? Wait no, for N+2=3 elements, indices are 0,1,2.

Wait, no, the interior points are from 1 to -1 (exclusive), which in a 3-element array would be only index 1. So yes.

But when N=1, i.e., a 2-element array (points 0 and 1). Then [1:-1] is empty because slice(1,-1) on a 2-element array is from index 1 to -1 (which is 1), so no elements.

Therefore, for N=1, the sum_neighbors would be zero. So:

sum_neighbors = 0

cn[0] = coefficient * cx[0] + other_term * 0 = coefficient * cx[0]

Similarly, cn[1] = coefficient * cx[1] + other_term * 0 = coefficient * cx[1]

Which makes sense because each point has only one neighbor (for N=1), but in the code, for i=0 and i=1, sum_neighbors is zero. Wait no:

Wait, when N=1, there are points 0 and 1.

In left_shift = roll left by 1: [cx[1], cx[0]]

right_shift = roll right by 1: [cx[1], cx[0]]

sum_neighbors for interior points (points 0 and 1? Wait, no. For N=2 (3 elements), interior points are index 1.

Wait, in the case of N=1, which has two points, 0 and 1, what is left_shift[1:-1]?

left_shift would be [cx[1], cx[0]]

So for a 2-element array, indices 0 and 1:

left_shift[1:-1] = left_shift[1: -1], which in this case, since len=2, -1 is index 1. So the slice from 1 to 1 (exclusive) is empty.

Therefore sum_neighbors would be zero for N=1, but that's incorrect because each point should have one neighbor. Wait maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait no: in our code, we are considering interior points as non-boundary points, which, when the array size is 3 (N=2), the boundaries are 0 and 2, leaving only 1 as interior. When N=1, which is a two-point system, points 0 and 1 would both be considered? Or no?

Wait in the code:

sum_neighbors = (left_shift[1:-1] + right_shift[1:-1]) / 2

For N=1: len(cx)=2.

So left_shift[1:-1] is from index 1 to -1 (which is index 1). So it's an empty slice, giving array of shape ().

Similarly for right_shift. Therefore sum_neighbors would be zero.

But in reality, both points have one neighbor each. So how should we handle this?

Wait perhaps the code as written doesn't support N=1 correctly. So maybe an alternative approach is needed where all interior points (points not on the boundaries) are considered, regardless of array size.

Alternatively, perhaps using a loop or another method to compute for each point whether it's interior and sum accordingly.

But given that this might complicate things, and considering that in most physical systems, N is at least 2 (so three points), maybe we can assume that the code works for N >= 2. Or adjust the slicing.

Alternatively, instead of using [1:-1], perhaps find all points that are not the first or last, regardless of array size.

In NumPy, to get all indices except the first and last:

mask = np.logical_and(indices != 0, indices != len(cx)-1)

Then extract those elements.

But let's see how to implement it without using masks.

Alternatively, another approach is to compute for each point whether it is an interior point, then sum their neighbors accordingly. But that might require O(n) time.

Given that performance isn't a concern here, perhaps we can write the code as:

def compute_cn(coefficient, other_term, cx):
    n = len(cx)
    cn = np.zeros_like(cx)
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        left = cx[i-1]
        right = cx[i+1]
        sum_neighbors = (left + right) / 2
        cn[i] = coefficient * cx[i] + other_term * sum_neighbors
    return cn

But that's a loop. If N is large, it might not be efficient, but for the problem at hand, maybe acceptable.

Alternatively, use vectorized operations to handle all points in one go, without loops.

Wait let me think: For each point i:

If i == 0 or i == n-1, cn[i] = 0 (as boundary)

Else, cn[i] = coefficient * cx[i] + other_term * (cx[i-1] + cx[i+1])/2

Therefore, in vectorized form:

interior_indices = np.logical_and(np.arange(n) != 0, np.arange(n) != n-1)
sum_neighbors = (np.roll(cx, -1)[interior_indices] + np.roll(cx, 1)[interior_indices]) / 2
cn[interior_indices] = coefficient * cx[interior_indices] + other_term * sum_neighbors

Yes, this should work.

So code can be written as:

def compute_cn(coefficient, other_term, cx):
    n = len(cx)
    # Identify interior points (not first or last)
    interior_indices = np.logical_and(np.arange(n) != 0, np.arange(n) != n-1)
    
    # Compute left and right shifts for interior indices
    left_shifted = np.roll(cx, -1)[interior_indices]
    right_shifted = np.roll(cx, 1)[interior_indices]
    
    sum_neighbors = (left_shifted + right_shifted) / 2
    
    cn[interior_indices] = coefficient * cx[interior_indices] + other_term * sum_neighbors
    return cn

This way, it handles all cases, including N=1. Let's test for N=1:

n=1: interior_indices is empty, so nothing happens, and cn remains zero.

For n=2:

indices 0 and 1 are both not interior? Because (np.arange(2) !=0 => [True, True], and np.arange(2)!=1 => [False, False]). So interior_indices = [False, False]. So no operations are done. But in reality, for a two-point system, each point is a boundary.

But if we set boundaries to have cn[i] = 0, then it's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the original approach is better with roll and slicing.

Wait in code:

For N=3 (points 0,1,2):

interior_indices are [True], since index 1 is interior.

left_shifted = cx[-1] => cx[2]

right_shifted = cx[1]

So sum_neighbors = (cx[2] + cx[1])/2

Then cn[1] = coefficient * cx[1] + other_term * (cx[1] + cx[2])/2

Which is correct.

For N=4:

interior indices are 1 and 2.

left_shifted for index 1: cx[0]

for index 2: cx[1]

right_shifted for index 1: cx[2]

for index 2: cx[3]

sum_neighbors = (cx[0] + cx[2])/2 for index 1

and (cx[1] + cx[3])/2 for index 2.

So cn[1] = coefficient * cx[1] + other_term*(cx[0]+cx[2])/2

cn[2] = coefficient * cx[2] + other_term*(cx[1]+cx[3])/2

Which is correct.

Therefore, the code seems to handle all cases. So in conclusion, perhaps using this vectorized approach with logical indices is more efficient and cleaner than loops.

So I think that's a better approach.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to compute an array `cn` where each element is determined by a specific formula applied to the original array `cx`. The formula involves both the value at each index and the average of its neighbors, with some coefficients. 

### Approach
The key steps in solving this problem are as follows:

1. **Identify Interior Points**: Determine which indices in the array `cx` are not boundary points (i.e., not the first or last element). These interior points will be used to compute the values for `cn`.

2. **Compute Neighbors' Average**: For each interior point, compute the average of its left and right neighbors. This is done efficiently using vectorized operations to avoid loops.

3. **Apply Formula**: For each interior point, apply the given formula to compute the corresponding value in `cn`. The boundary points are set to zero as they have no neighbors.

### Solution Code
```python
def compute_cn(coefficient, other_term, cx):
    n = len(cx)
    # Identify which indices are interior (not first or last)
    interior_indices = np.logical_and(
        np.arange(n) != 0,
        np.arange(n) != n - 1
    )
    
    # Compute the left and right shifts for the interior indices
    left_shifted = np.roll(cx, -1)[interior_indices]
    right_shifted = np.roll(cx, 1)[interior_indices]
    
    # Calculate the sum of neighbors for each interior index
    sum_neighbors = (left_shifted + right_shifted) / 2
    
    # Compute cn values for interior indices
    cn_interior = coefficient * cx[interior_indices] + other_term * sum_neighbors
    
    # Create the cn array initialized with zeros
    cn = np.zeros(n, dtype=np.float64)
    cn[interior_indices] = cn_interior
    
    return cn
```

### Explanation
1. **Identify Interior Points**: The code uses `np.logical_and` to create a boolean mask indicating which indices are interior (not the first or last). This ensures that only relevant points are processed.

2. **Compute Neighbors' Average**: Using `np.roll`, the array is shifted left and right to access neighbor values. These shifted values are then averaged for each interior point.

3. **Apply Formula**: The computed average of neighbors is used in the formula to update the corresponding values in `cn`. Boundary points remain zero as specified.

This approach efficiently handles the computation using vectorized operations, ensuring that the solution is both clean and performant.
